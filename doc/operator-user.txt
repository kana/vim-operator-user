INTRODUCTION					*operator-user-introduction*

*operator-user* is a Vim library plugin to provide an easy way to define your
own |operator|.  Though there are several pitfalls to define operators, you
don't have to take care of them with |operator#user#define()| which are
provided by this library plugin.

For example, the following code defines operator "_" to adjust the height of
the current window to the same as the target range:
>
	map _  <Plug>(operator-adjust)
	call operator#user#define('adjust', 'Op_adjust_window_height')
	function! Op_adjust_window_height(motion_wiseness)
	  execute (line("']") - line("'[") + 1) 'wincmd' '_'
	  normal! `[zt
	endfunction
<
You can use this operator as follows:

	10__	Adjust to 10 lines and show the current line at the top.
	_ip	Adjust to the same height of the paragraph under the cursor.

This operator is useful to adjust the visible content in the current window.

See also |operator-user-examples| for more examples and explanations.

INTERFACE					*operator-user-interface*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FUNCTIONS					*operator-user-functions*

						*operator#user#define()*
operator#user#define({name}, {function}, [{extra} ...])
			Define a new operator.

			{name}		(string)
				The name of the operator to be defined.

				In Normal mode and Visual mode,
				<Plug>(operator-{name}) is mapped to a magic
				stuff to execute the operator.

				In Operator-pending mode,
				<Plug>(operator-{name}) is mapped to |g@| to
				operate linewise like |cc|, |dd|, etc.

			{function}	(string)
				The name of a function to be called whenever
				the operator is executed.

			{extra}		(string)
				An arbitrary Ex command to be executed after
				setting 'operatorfunc' and before executing
				the operator.

				If multiple {extra}s are given, they are
				joined together into one string.  A whitespace
				is put in between them.  Then the string will
				be used instead.

				See also |operator-user-examples| how to use.

					   *operator#user#define_ex_command()*
operator#user#define_ex_command({name}, {ex-command})
			Define an operator-version of {ex-command}.

			{name}		(string)
				Same as the one for |operator#user#define()|.

			{ex-command}	(string)
				An Ex command to be executed whenever the
				operator is executed.  Range must not be
				included.

				This argument is used as follows:
>
					'[,']{ex-command}
<

						*operator#user#register()*
operator#user#register()
			Return the name of the last register which is given to
			a custom operator defined by |operator-user|.  Use
			this function instead of |v:register|, because
			v:register might be overwritten if a custom operator
			is combined with a custom text object.

			       *operator#user#visual_command_from_wise_name()*
operator#user#visual_command_from_wise_name({wise-name})
			Return a "visual command" corresponding to
			{wise-name}, where a "visual command" is a string
			corresponding to one of the following commands: |v|,
			|V| or |<C-v>|.

			{wise-name}	(string)
				The name of a wise of {motion} or {Visual}.
				It can be one of the following values:
				"char", "line", "block".

			See |operator-user-examples-D| for usage.

EXAMPLES					*operator-user-examples*

						*operator-user-examples-A*
(A) The following setting defines operator-version of |:right|, and map "L" to
execute the operator:
>
	map L  <Plug>(operator-align-right)
	call operator#user#define('align-right', 'Op_command_right')
	function! Op_command_right(motion_wiseness)
	  '[,']right
	endfunction
<

						*operator-user-examples-B*
(B) The following setting defines a generic version of (A).
    This is also an example to use {extra} for |operator#user#define()|:
>
	map H  <Plug>(operator-align-left)
	map L  <Plug>(operator-align-right)
	map M  <Plug>(operator-align-center)

	call operator#user#define('align-left', 'Op_command',
	\                         'call Set_op_command("left")')
	call operator#user#define('align-right', 'Op_command',
	\                         'call Set_op_command("right")')
	call operator#user#define('align-center', 'Op_command',
	\                         'call Set_op_command("center")')

	let s:op_command_command = ''

	function! Set_op_command(command)
	  let s:op_command_command = a:command
	endfunction

	function! Op_command(motion_wiseness)
	  execute "'[,']" s:op_command_command
	endfunction
<

						*operator-user-examples-C*
(C) With |operator#user#define_ex_command()|, the example (B) can be
    simplified as follows:
>
	map H  <Plug>(operator-align-left)
	map L  <Plug>(operator-align-right)
	map M  <Plug>(operator-align-center)

	call operator#user#define_ex_command('align-left', 'left')
	call operator#user#define_ex_command('align-right', 'right')
	call operator#user#define_ex_command('align-center', 'center')
<

						*operator-user-examples-D*
(D) In 'operatorfunc', we usually have to convert the name of the wise of
{motion} into the corresponding command to start Visual mode.
With |operator#user#visual_command_from_wise_name()|,
This routine can be written as follows:
>
	call operator#user#define('void-change', 'OperatorVoidDelete')
	function! OperatorVoidDelete(motion_wise)
	  let v = operator#user#visual_command_from_wise_name(a:motion_wise)
	  execute 'normal!' '`[' . v . '`]"_d'
	endfunction
<
This operator itself is not useful.  But it can be used as a template to
define useful operators, for example, an operator to replace a target text
with a register content.

BUGS						*operator-user-bugs*

If you have any problems except the following, please send a feedback at:
https://github.com/kana/vim-operator-user/issues

						*operator-user-bugs-A*
(A) |operator#user#define()| defines a key mapping "<Plug>(operator-{name}) to
    |g@|" in Operator-pending mode to select text linewise like |cc|, |dd|,
    etc.  But this behavior may be harmful in the following sense:

    If you define two operators "A" and "B", you can operate the cursor line
    with "AA" and "BB".  But you can ALSO operate the cursor line with "AB"
    and "BA".  These "{operator-A}{operator-B}" key combinations are not
    expected to work as if "{operator-A}{operator-A}", because there is no
    such default key binding.

						*operator-user-bugs-B*
(B) In Visual mode, any operator defined by |operator#user#define()| cannot
    handle |count| correctly.  It acts as if count is not given.

						*operator-user-bugs-C*
(C) |operator#user#define()| defines "named" key mappings
    "<Plug>(operator-{name})" to execute an operator, and you have to define
    other key mappings to type to execute the operator.  |operator-user|
    doesn't provide any official way to skip defining "named" key mappings.
    It is an intentional design.

    See also the following article for the details.
    The article is also useful if you want to write your own plulgin:
    ``Vim: Plugins should provide "named" key sequences to customize hotkeys,
    not variables'' <http://whileimautomaton.net/2008/09/27/02/27/35/diary>




==============================================================================
CHANGELOG					*operator-user-changelog*

0.1.0	2015-02-17T21:38:32+09:00	       *operator-user-changelog-0.1.0*
	- Add |operator#user#register()| for custom operators which use
	  |registers|.

0.0.9	2014-03-12T22:36:36+09:00	       *operator-user-changelog-0.0.9*
	- Fix a bug that counts are not handled correctly since Vim 7.3.086.
	  With Vim 7.3.086 or later and operator-user 0.0.8 or ealier, a count
	  given to a custom operator is ignored.  For example, if "_" is
	  mapped to a custom operator, "2__" targets single line instead of
	  two lines, and "2_3_" targets only two lines instead of six lines.

0.0.8	2014-03-06T23:49:34+09:00	       *operator-user-changelog-0.0.8*
	- Fix wrong implementation of |operator-user-examples-D|.
	- Refine tests.

0.0.7	2012-06-02T14:11:08+09:00	       *operator-user-changelog-0.0.7*
	- |operator#user#define_ex_command|:
	  Support {ex-command} including "'".
	  For example: s/"/'/g
	- Refine old-style test scripts.

0.0.6	2009-09-10T20:36:13+09:00	       *operator-user-changelog-0.0.6*
	- Add links for scripts that use this plugin.
	  See |operator-user-introduction|.
	- Refine the document a bit.
	- Refine the internal structure a bit.

0.0.5	2009-09-08T07:28:56+09:00	       *operator-user-changelog-0.0.5*
	- Add |operator#user#visual_command_from_wise_name()|.
	- Revise a bit of the document.

0.0.4	2009-09-07T20:18:31+09:00	       *operator-user-changelog-0.0.4*
	- Fix a bug that it rarely fails to select the same text as a given
	  {motion} in Normal mode.  It is caused by a bug in Vim; |v:count1|
	  may be 0 in some cases.
	- Fix a bug that register designation ("a, "b, etc) doesn't work for
	  user defiend operators.

0.0.3	2009-09-04T20:11:07+09:00	       *operator-user-changelog-0.0.3*
	Incompatible change:
	- |operator#user#define()|, |operator#user#define_ex_command()|:
	  Change the meaning of the first argument:

	  Old versions:
		  The argument is {lhs} to execute the operator to be defined.

	  New version:
		  The argument is {name} of the operator to be defined.
		  {lhs} to execute the operator is "<Plug>(operator-{name})".

	  See also |operator-user-bugs-C| for the details.

0.0.2	2009-09-04T05:58:28+09:00	       *operator-user-changelog-0.0.2*
	- Add |operator#user#define_ex_command()|.
	- Add a note on a bug.  See |operator-user-bugs-B| for the details.
	- Remove :DefineOperator.  It's useless as a part of this library.

0.0.1	2009-07-18T04:41:22+09:00	       *operator-user-changelog-0.0.1*
	- Rename as "operator-user".  The old name "myoperator" is not good
	  for further works.

0.0.0	2009-06-26T02:51:29+09:00	       *operator-user-changelog-0.0.0*
	- Initial version.
